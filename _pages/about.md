Welcome to my website. Here you'll find some information about myself. I'll also share blog posts and project overviews here. 

Even though, many people might say, "Why do you need a website in 2023?" This is my initiative to adhere to the decentralized idea of the WWW.

If you have any questions, feedback, or just want to say "hi" feel free to reach out on any of the channels below.

Cheers,

Felix
